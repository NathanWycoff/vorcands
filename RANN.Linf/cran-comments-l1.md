- New submission, originally submitted as RANN1
- Difference to existing package RANN: Metric used for computing distances.  RANN uses L2, RANN.L1 uses L1.  The underlying ANN library requires changing of preprocessor defines to change the metric; using two similar R packages seems to be the simplest solution to provide ANN implementations with different metrics for the R community.
- Checked against R 3.2.0 on Ubuntu, R-devel (r68301) on Debian and R 3.2.0 and R-devel (r68289) on win-builder
- Fixed quoting of 'RANN' in description
