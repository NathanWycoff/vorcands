Package: RANN.Linf
Title: Fast Nearest Neighbour Search (Wraps ANN Library) Using
    Linf/Max Metric
Version: 2.6.1
Author: Sunil Arya and David Mount (for ANN), Samuel E. Kemp,
    Gregory Jefferis, Nathan Wycoff (uncommented appropriate lines to have it do Linf instead of L2.)
Maintainer: Nathan Wycoff <nathan.wycoff@georgetown.edu>
Description: Finds the k nearest neighbours for every point in a
    given dataset in O(N log N) time using Arya and Mount's ANN library
    (v1.1.3). There is support for approximate as well as exact searches,
    fixed radius searches and 'bd' as well as 'kd' trees. The distance is
    computed using the Linf (Maximum) metric. Please see package 'RANN.L1'
    for the same functionality using the L1 (Manhattan, taxicab) metric.
