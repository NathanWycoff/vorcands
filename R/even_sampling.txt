Conjecture: the following algo gives points evenly spread across the Voronoi boundary.

Initialize with two random points.
To get the i+1th point:
    1) Find the nearest neighbor of all points.
    2) Take the point whose nearest neighbor is farthest. 
    3) Project the midpoint of that point and its nearest neighbor onto the voronoi boundary.

hey, what if the two random points are on the same face? That clearly would not explore any other faces.

What if we instead start with the axis-aligned shit? Would that work? Or can that still miss faces?

Regretablly, the issue actually seems to be that i can get caught up in a projection that doesn't improve the max distance, and so just keeps getting tried. Does skipping to the next one solve the problem?
